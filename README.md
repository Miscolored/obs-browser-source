A full-on OBS score tracking script.

The script deploys a local web-app that shows the score (for use
as an OBS browser source), as well as allowing the cores to be clicked
to update them while you play. You can reach and click to change
scores from any iphone, computer, or tablet on the OBS-computer network.
